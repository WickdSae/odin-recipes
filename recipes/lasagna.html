    <h1>The lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <img src="/home/wickdsae/odin-links-and-images/lasagna.jpeg" alt="Homemade Lasagna">
    <p>Lasagne, also lasagna, is both a form of pasta in sheets (often rippled in North America, though seldom so in Italy) and also a dish, 
        sometimes named Lasagne al forno (meaning "Lasagne in the oven") made with alternate layers of pasta, cheese, and rag√π (a meat sauce). 
        While it is traditionally believed to have originated in Italy, then evidence has come to light suggesting that a very similar meal known as "loseyns" 
        (pronounced 'lasan') was eaten in the court of King Richard II in the 14th Century. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>9 Lasagna Noodles</li>
            <li>All purpose flour</li>
            <li>Vegetable broth</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Zucchini</li>
            <li>Spinach</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
            <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
